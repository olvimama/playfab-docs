Welcome to a Microsoft Learn video. Today, we're excited to guide you through the process of integrating PlayFab data analytics with Microsoft Fabric. 
This integration empowers game developers by providing full control over data visualization, tailored to their studio's needs.

In this video, we'll cover four main steps. 

First, we'll guide you through the process of setting up a workspace on Microsoft Fabric and creating a KQL database within it. 
This is where all your PlayFab events will flow into.

We'll walk you through each step in detail. 
This begins with opening a web browser and navigating to powerbi.com, then creating a new workspace and filling out the necessary information. 
We'll also guide you through the process of creating a KQL database.

Second, we'll show you how to establish a connection between your Microsoft Fabric workspace and your PlayFab game title. 
This connection is crucial for the seamless flow of data between the two platforms.

We'll show you how to create a data connection. 
This involves copying the Query URI from your workspace, signing into your PlayFab Game Manager account, and creating a new connection. 
This connection will ensure that all your events can flow into the KQL database.

Third, we'll demonstrate how to take your game data and upload it to a provided Power BI template. 
For this walkthrough, we'll use sample data. 
This step will help you visualize your game data in a way that best suits your needs.

We'll then demonstrate how to import sample data to visualize our output using a PowerBI dashboard. 
This involves creating players in the Game Manager and downloading the Power BI template from the PlayFab repository in GitHub.

Finally, we'll publish your template and show you how to view it in your Microsoft Fabric workspace. 
This is where you'll be able to see all your data and reports in one place.

We'll walk you through publishing your template to Microsoft Fabric. 
We'll guide you on how to view your database and reports in your workspace. 
We'll also provide guidance on how to handle any missing credentials errors and update authorization permissions.

The entire process should take less than 10 minutes to set up. 

Remember, the amount of data available depends on when you created the data connection, as PlayFab does not backfile data. 
We hope you find this guide helpful in learning about PlayFab and Microsoft Fabric integration.
