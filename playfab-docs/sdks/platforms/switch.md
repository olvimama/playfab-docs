# PlayFab Services SDKs for Nintendo Switch

The following SDKs are available for game client development on Nintendo Switch. The right SDK depends mostly on your choice of game engine.

| PlayFab SDK    | Description | Learn More |

| C/C++          | Newest SDK featuring a portable C interface and granting full control of memory and threading to the game developer. Intended for integration into high performance game engines. | [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md) |
| Unreal         | An Unreal Engine marketplace plugin designed for use with either C++ or blueprint. | [Unreal SDK Overview](../unreal/index.md) |

| Legacy C++     | Our older cross-platform C++ SDK supports a simple REST-like interface with PlayFab across multiple platforms. | [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md) |

## Getting Access to SDKs for Nintendo Switch

Our PlayFab Services SDKs for Unreal and Unity are platform-agnostic. As such, they require no special access or permissions from PlayFab to utilize on any platform.

To utilize our C/C++ or Legacy C++ SDKs on Switch, you must get middleware approval from Nintendo. Once you have approval, we can grant access to the SDK. Learn more about this process here: [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md).
