## Getting Access to SDKs for PS4™ and PS5®

Our PlayFab Services SDKs for Unreal and Unity are platform-agnostic. As such, they require no special access or permissions from PlayFab to utilize on any platform.

To utilize our C/C++ or Legacy C++ SDKs on PS4™ and PS5®, you must confirm your developer status via DevNet. Once you have approval, we can grant access to the SDK. Learn more about this process here: [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md).
