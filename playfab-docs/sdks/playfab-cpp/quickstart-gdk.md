# Quickstart: C/C++ for GDK

Starting with the March 2023 release, the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) includes the PlayFab Services SDK as an extension library. That means you can include PlayFab in your Xbox and Windows games without another SDK download.

To learn more about PlayFab in the GDK, see [GDK - Quickstart](../c/quickstart-gdk.md).
