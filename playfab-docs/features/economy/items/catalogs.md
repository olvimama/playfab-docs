# Catalogs (Legacy Economy)

[!INCLUDE [notice](../../../includes/_economy-deprecation.md)]

This tutorial describes the **Catalogs** tab in the **Economy** section in **Game Manager**. Catalogs are used to define items that the player can purchase or that you can award to a player.

## What is a catalog?

Many games offer the player items for purchase such as a shield, a level-unlock, or a power-up. These items are specified in a catalog in units of either virtual currency or real money. Catalogs offer an easy way to manage your game's virtual items and can hold every item available in your game.

Before a player can purchase an item from a catalog, you must first create the items.

PlayFabâ€™s [Player Item Management (Server)](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.server.playeritemmanagement) and [Player Item Management (Client)](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.playeritemmanagement) APIs support many strategies for item purchasing, including:

* Simple real money or virtual currency purchases of items.
* Triggered item grants based on buying another item.
* Locked (with a potentially purchasable key) and unlocked boxes.
* Random result tables.
* Non-purchasable items that are granted based on events within a game.

> [!NOTE]
> In catalogs, the currency type of **RM** is reserved for **real money**, which is in cents USD. $1.99 is represented as **RM 199**.

## Field reference

This section describes each field in the **Catalogs** section of the **Economy** area in **Game Manager**.

When you first create a title, you have no catalogs. You won't see any fields in the **Catalogs** section until you create a catalog by selecting the **NEW CATALOG** button.

Once a catalog is created, you'll see the following tabs in the **Catalogs** section:

* **Items** - Things that have a value in virtual currency or real money that can be purchased or awarded. For more information, see [PlayFab items](index.md).
* **Bundles** - Collections of items and virtual currency that unpack into a player's inventory when granted.
* **Containers** - Collections of items and virtual currency that remain as an item in the player's inventory until opened.
* **Drop Tables** - Collections of items and virtual currency you can use to reward players.
* **Stores** - Stores serve a subset of catalog items. These items can be offered at alternative prices to prices set in the catalog. For more information, see [PlayFab Stores](../stores/index.md).
