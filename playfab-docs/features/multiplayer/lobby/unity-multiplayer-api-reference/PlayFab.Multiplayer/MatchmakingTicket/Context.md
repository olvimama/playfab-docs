# MatchmakingTicket.Context property

The custom context of the matchmaking ticket

```csharp
public object Context { get; set; }
```
## get
Retrieves the app's private, custom pointer-sized context value previously associated with this matchmaking ticket object.

## set
Configures an optional, custom pointer-sized context value with this matchmaking ticket object.

## Remarks

If no custom context has been set yet, the value is set to nullptr.

The custom context is typically used as a "shortcut" that simplifies accessing local, title-specific memory
associated with the matchmaking ticket without requiring a mapping lookup.
