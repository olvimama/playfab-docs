# Tracing/logging instructions for Azure Playfab Party SDKs

This topic describes how to capture diagnostic traces generated by the Azure PlayFab Party SDKs.

> [!NOTE]
> Our SDKs undergo internal testing before every release to ensure the expected level of functionality and normally don't require logging to be enabled by default, particularly in the shipping version of your game.
>
> However, sometimes it may be needed to capture and share produced logs with Microsoft for troubleshooting and diagnostic purposes.

The type of logs and the way logging should be configured/captured depends on a platform. Our middleware SDKs (Unity and Unreal) use Party C++ SDKs as an underlying dependency component, and a process of configuring/capturing logs for them is the same or very similar to the process for a corresponding C++ SDK. All necessary instructions and pointers are listed in the table below:

## Per platform logging instructions

| Platform | Log format | Logging instruction guidance location |
