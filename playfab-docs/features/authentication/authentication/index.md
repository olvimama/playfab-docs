# What is PlayFab Authentication? 

PlayFab helps you authenticate players using a breadth of providers. You can provide players different ways to authenticate themselves and link their favorite accounts to enable roaming and recovery. Use this section to learn more about how PlayFab helps you enable Player Auth.

PlayFab also supports multiple methods for Game Manager account authentication through its own and Microsoft's authentication services. You can learn more about them in the Microsoft Authentication for Game Manager section.
