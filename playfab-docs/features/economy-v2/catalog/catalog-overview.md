# Catalog overview

[!INCLUDE [notice](../../../includes/_economy-deprecation.md)]

This overview describes the **Catalog V2** tab in the **Economy** section in **Game Manager**. It describes the Catalog feature in PlayFab Economy V2, and goes over all of the field properties for the various Item Types.

## What is a catalog?

A Catalog is used to define items that a player can purchase or that you can award to a player. Many games offer the player items for purchase such as a shield, a level-unlock, or a power-up. These items are specified in a catalog and often sold for virtual currency or real money. PlayFab's Catalog offers an easy way to manage your game's virtual items and can hold every item available in your game.

## Item field references

This section describes each field in the **Catalog V2** section of the **Economy** area in **Game Manager**.

When you first create a title, your catalog is empty. You won't see any items in the **Catalog** section until you create them.

The following tabs exist in the **Catalog v2** section:

Tab | Description | Reference
---|---|---
**Items** | Things that have a value in virtual currency or real money that can be purchased or awarded. | [PlayFab Economy V2 Items](../inventory/items-and-inventory-overview.md)
**Currency** | Virtual currency can be used to purchase other catalog items. | [PlayFab Economy V2 Currencies](../tutorials/currencies.md)
**UGC** | User Created items. | [PlayFab Economy V2 UGC](../ugc/index.md)
**Bundles** | Collections of items and virtual currency that unpack into a player's inventory when granted. A bundle can be linked to real world purchases using the Marketplace Mapping field. | [PlayFab Economy V2 Bundles](../bundles.md)
**Stores** | Stores allow you to override base catalog prices for items. | [PlayFab Economy V2 Stores](../stores.md)
**Subscriptions** |   Virtual subscriptions allow you to grant time based access to durable goods. | [PlayFab Economy V2 Subscriptions](../subscriptions.md).

Each of these is an Item Type that can be used within your Catalog. Bundles 

### Catalog V2 item fields

When you select a **Catalog V2**, the **Items** tab, and choose **NEW ITEM**, you'll see the following page:

![Game Manager - Economy - Catalogs- New Catalog Item](../media/playfab-economy-v2-item-details.png)  

The **New Item** page contains these fields. Unless *_noted_*, these fields are optional:

* **PROPERTIES**
  * **Creator Entity Type**:
    A *_system created_* field that tells you the type of Entity creator. 
  * **Creator Entity ID**:
    A unique ID for the entity creator. In Game Manager, this ID is set to the value of the title.
  * **Friendly ID**:
  A field that can used for easier reference in code. Friendly IDs are optional for all items and must be unique within the catalog.
  * **Title**:
  A *_required_* field for the common name of the Item that is normally displayed to the player. Simple localization of **Title** is supported by using locale keys. For more information, see [Economy V2 Localization](../catalog/Localization.md).
  * **Default Stack ID**:
  Items can be stored in inventory as stacks each with their own amount and differentiated by StackId. If not defined, inventory actions will use _default_ as the StackId.  For more information, see [Economy Stacks](../inventory/stacks.md).
  * **Keywords**:
  Keywords can be used for basic search filtering. They are a dictionary of localized keywords in JSON format. For an example, see [Economy V2 Localization](../catalog/Localization.md).

  * **Available Tags**
  Convenient dropdown for selecting Item tags already defined in the Catalog Config.
  * **OPTIONS**
     * **Hidden**:
   There is currently a single option available for Items listed in this section. This option, *_Hidden_*, keeps the Item from being exposed with search.
  * **Start Date**:
     A *_required_* date field for when the Item should be made available in search.
  * **End Date**:
    A date field to designate when the Item should be made unavailable in search.

    You can use this section to specify one or more purchase price(s) for the item. 
* **FILES**
  * **Upload**:
    Here you can upload content to be stored in the public catalog that can be associated with this item.
* **IMAGES**
  * **Upload**:
    Here you can upload various images, including thumbnails and screenshots, for item displays in your in-game catalog. 
* **PLATFORMS**
  * **Manage**:
    You can specify which platforms this item is for. The Platform list is defined in Catalog Settings (Title Settings > Economy).  

### Saving your items to a Draft or a Publish state
The Economy V2 catalog supports a *_Draft_* item state. When you *Save as Draft* the item metadata is available via direct call but is not exposed to public search. When you are ready to make your item public you set it to a *_Published_* state. You can read more about this on our [Item Status](../catalog/item-status.md) page.
