# PFAuthenticationGetEntityRequest  

PFAuthenticationGetEntityRequest data model. This API must be called with X-SecretKey, X-Authentication or X-EntityToken headers. An optional EntityKey may be included to attempt to set the resulting EntityToken to a specific entity, however the entity must be a relation of the caller, such as the master_player_account of a character. If sending X-EntityToken the account will be marked as freshly logged in and will issue a new token. If using X-Authentication or X-EntityToken the header must still be valid and cannot be expired or revoked.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
typedef struct PFAuthenticationGetEntityRequest {  
    PFStringDictionaryEntry const* customTags;  
    uint32_t customTagsCount;  
    PFEntityKey const* entity;  
} PFAuthenticationGetEntityRequest;  
```
  
### Members  
  
**`customTags`** &nbsp; PFStringDictionaryEntry const*  
*may be nullptr*  
  
(Optional) The optional custom tags associated with the request (e.g. build number, external trace identifiers, etc.).
  
**`customTagsCount`** &nbsp; uint32_t  
  
Count of customTags
  
**`entity`** &nbsp; PFEntityKey const*  
*may be nullptr*  
  
(Optional) The optional entity to perform this action on. Defaults to the currently logged in entity.
