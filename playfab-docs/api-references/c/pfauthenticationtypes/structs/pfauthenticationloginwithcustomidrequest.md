# PFAuthenticationLoginWithCustomIDRequest  

PFAuthenticationLoginWithCustomIDRequest data model. It is highly recommended that developers ensure that it is extremely unlikely that a customer could generate an ID which is already in use by another customer. If this is the first time a user has signed in with the Custom ID and CreateAccount is set to true, a new PlayFab account will be created and linked to the Custom ID. In this case, no email or username will be associated with the PlayFab account. Otherwise, if no PlayFab account is linked to the Custom ID, an error indicating this will be returned, so that the title can guide the user through creation of a PlayFab account.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
typedef struct PFAuthenticationLoginWithCustomIDRequest {  
    bool createAccount;  
    const char* customId;  
    PFStringDictionaryEntry const* customTags;  
    uint32_t customTagsCount;  
    PFGetPlayerCombinedInfoRequestParams const* infoRequestParameters;  
    const char* playerSecret;  
} PFAuthenticationLoginWithCustomIDRequest;
