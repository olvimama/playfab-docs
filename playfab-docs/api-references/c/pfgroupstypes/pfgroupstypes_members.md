| [PFGroupsAcceptGroupApplicationRequest](structs/pfgroupsacceptgroupapplicationrequest.md) | PFGroupsAcceptGroupApplicationRequest data model. Accepts an outstanding invitation to to join a group if the invited entity is not blocked by the group. Nothing is returned in the case of success. |  
| [PFGroupsAcceptGroupInvitationRequest](structs/pfgroupsacceptgroupinvitationrequest.md) | PFGroupsAcceptGroupInvitationRequest data model. Accepts an outstanding invitation to join the group if the invited entity is not blocked by the group. Only the invited entity or a parent in its chain (e.g. title) may accept the invitation on the invited entity's behalf. Nothing is returned in the case of success. |  
| [PFGroupsAddMembersRequest](structs/pfgroupsaddmembersrequest.md) | PFGroupsAddMembersRequest data model. Adds members to a group or role. Existing members of the group will added to roles within the group, but if the user is not already a member of the group, only title claimants may add them to the group, and others must use the group application or invite system to add new members to a group. Returns nothing if successful. |  
| [PFGroupsApplyToGroupRequest](structs/pfgroupsapplytogrouprequest.md) | PFGroupsApplyToGroupRequest data model. Creates an application to join a group. Calling this while a group application already exists will return the same application instead of an error and will not refresh the time before the application expires. By default, if the entity has an invitation to join the group outstanding, this will accept the invitation to join the group instead and return an error indicating such, rather than creating a duplicate application to join that will need to be cleaned up later. Returns information about the application or an error indicating an invitation was accepted instead. |  
| [PFGroupsApplyToGroupResponse](structs/pfgroupsapplytogroupresponse.md) | PFGroupsApplyToGroupResponse data model. Describes an application to join a group. |

| [PFGroupsChangeMemberRoleRequest](structs/pfgroupschangememberrolerequest.md) | PFGroupsChangeMemberRoleRequest data model. Changes the role membership of a list of entities from one role to another in in a single operation. The destination role must already exist.

| [PFGroupsDeleteGroupRequest](structs/pfgroupsdeletegrouprequest.md) | PFGroupsDeleteGroupRequest data model. Deletes a group and all roles, invitations, join requests, and blocks associated with it. Permission to delete is only required the group itself to execute this action.
