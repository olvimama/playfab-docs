# PlayStream Overview

PlayStream is a real-time event processing pipeline and monitoring system that provides you with a powerful toolset to gain insights into player behavior and engagement. With PlayStream, you can create personalized experiences and targeted messaging based on specific player actions and attributes. PlayStream captures and processes real-time events from players and the game, enabling you to respond quickly to changes in player behavior and make adjustments to game mechanics or content as needed.

As a game developer, you can define and emit custom PlayStream events to track specific player behaviors or in-game events. PlayStream provides you with tools and dashboards to visualize the data collected from these in-game events, allowing you to gain valuable insights into player engagement, retention, and other key metrics. In addition, PlayStream can be used for LiveOps and player engagement by tracking player behavior and enabling you to make informed decisions about game updates and events.
