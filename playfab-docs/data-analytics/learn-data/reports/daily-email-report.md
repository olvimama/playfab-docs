# Daily Title report email

The Daily Title report contains statistics for daily engagement and revenue for your title. The table contains the following metrics:

- **Engagement**: **DAU** (Daily Active Users), **New Players**, **MAU** (Monthly Active Users), **Total number of logins**, **Day 1 retention**, and **Day 7 retention**. 
- **Revenue**, **Transaction revenue**, **Playing players**, **ARPU** (Average revenue per user), **ARPPU** (Average revenue per paying user), **Day 1 conversion**, and **Day 7 conversion**.

The report can assist you in identifying trends and identifying changes happening daily in your title.
